# Landing Zone Deployment Steps (to be expanded)

## Prerequisites 
The following configuration is completed prior to the Landing Zone implementation
* Naming and Tagging Standard
* Azure Subscription as per Tenant Hierarchy Guidelines
* Landing Zone IP Address Management (IPAM) design
* Execute Azure Guardrail Implementation Guide v0.12 
* Assign PBMM Blueprint and configure Log Analytics Workspace

## Pre-Deployment Steps
These steps are executed before executing the Terraform deployment
* Download Landing Zone repository
* Modify config.tf to match your configuration and automation account
* Verify storage accounts
* Copy the Fortigate license files into the \Terraform\FG
* Paste F5 license keys into \Terraform\F5\f5_api_data.tf (line 5 and 41)
* Update config.tf with your environment's values (in \terraform, \terraform\F5, and \terraform\Deployment_Host)
* Configure a deployment host (one is provided with the LZ deployment package)

## Deployment Steps
Follow these steps to deploy the Landing Zone
* Open default Terraform folder in VS Code or IDE of choice (PowerShell works)
* Run Terraform init to initialize the working folder
* Run Terraform Plan - review
* Run Terraform Apply - review
* Log into the Azure portal and delete LzPcADC-FGVM-lb (load balancer) and LzPcCNR-Core-Tranisit-rt (route table) 
* Reboot the Fortigate Firewalls (will connect to the Internet and install license keys)
* Re-run Terraform apply after verifing license keys (reinstall the lb and rt)
* Open Azure portal, navigate to policies / assignments and locate the "Network interfaces should not have public IPs" policy
* Exclude the "LzPc-Security_Core_External-rg" and "LzPc-System_Core-rg" resource groups from the policy
* Switch to the F5 directory and run Terraform init to initialize the working folder
* Run Terraform Plan - review
* Run Terraform Apply - review

## Post-Deployment Steps
Execute the following steps post deployment
* Create a public IP address on LzPcSWJ-RDS01 and update the LzPcCNR-MRZ-MAZ-nsg to only allow inbound RDP from the your current environment
* Setup Remote Access Proxy and SSL Certificate on F5 (see reference documentation)
* Test inbound RDP to the MAZ and remove the public IP from LzPcSWJ-RDS01
* Configure required accounts and reset all passwords
* Move all code to LzPcSWJ-RDSH01 (or git repository of choice) and delete Deployment Host
* Remove public IPs from management interfaces on F5VM01 and F5VM02
